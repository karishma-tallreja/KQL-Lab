# KQL Overview ‚Äì Investigating with ELK 

## üîç Objective

- Understand and apply **Kibana Query Language (KQL)** for log analysis.
- Differentiate between **free-text** and **field-based** search methods.
- Learn to use **wildcards** and **logical operators** in KQL.
- Perform log filtering and incident-based investigations using KQL in Kibana.

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Kibana** (via ELK Stack on TryHackMe)
- **ElasticSearch**
- **TryHackMe Platform (Investigating with ELK 101 room)**

---

## üìö Skills Learned

- Basics of **KQL (Kibana Query Language)**.
- Effective **log searching and filtering** using:
  - Free-text queries.
  - Field-based queries with specific syntax.
- Application of **logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)** in queries.
- Usage of **wildcards** (`*`) for partial term searches.
- Real-world **SIEM investigation use cases** using VPN log data.
- Understanding how query precision affects **log hit counts**.
- Filtering based on field values like `Source_Country`, `UserName`, `Source_ip`.

---

## üß† What I Learned

- How to distinguish between **exact term matching** and **partial matching**.
- Importance of correct syntax (`FIELD : VALUE`) in field-based queries.
- That **KQL doesn‚Äôt tokenize words**, so `United` won‚Äôt match `United States` unless using wildcards.
- Efficient ways to exclude unwanted data using the `NOT` operator.
- Applying multiple conditions to extract meaningful logs for analysis.
- How to construct real-time investigative queries based on specific scenarios (e.g., terminated users, suspicious IPs).
